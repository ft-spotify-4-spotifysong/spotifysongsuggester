Spotify Song Recommender

We utilized Flask to build an application analyzing song features from Spotify's API. 

Our prediction model was built with K Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm from Scikit Learn's Libary.  Using features like danceability, tempo, duration, and energy our app can quickly find and recommend additional tracks. The application let's the user input a single track and in return the user can request up to 40 similar tracks.

Please feel free to clone the repository and build additional features or contact us with suggestions.

Enjoy!
