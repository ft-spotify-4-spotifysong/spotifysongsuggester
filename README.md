Spotify Song Recommender

We utilized Flask to build an application analyzing song features from Spotify's API. 

Our prediction model was built with K Nearest Neighbors machine learning algorithm from Scikit Learn's Libary.  Using features like danceability, tempo, duration, and energy our app can quickly find and recommend additional tracks. 

Functions of APP:
• The application let's the user select a single track and in return the user can request any number of similar tracks. 
• The distance image tells user how close each of the top 10 suggested songs is to the selected song. 
• Recent suggested songs are instored in DB database, so user can check their previous request of songs.

Please feel free to clone the repository and build additional features or contact us with suggestions.

Enjoy!
